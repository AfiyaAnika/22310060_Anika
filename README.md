## Introduction
This repository presents a curated collection of academic projects centered on advanced statistical analysis and data science. It features rigorous implementations of multivariate techniques such as **Factor Analysis**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, various clustering algorithms like **DBSCAN**, and **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**. Each project, developed in both **Jupyter Notebook using Python** and **R studio** to demonstrate both a firm theoretical understanding and a proficient practical application of these methods on sample datasets.

## Software and packages
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for writing and running Python code.
- **R Studio** - An integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for the R programming language, used for statistical computing and graphics.
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing and array operations.
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning and statistical modeling, including:
- **Matplotlib** – A foundational Python library for creating a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive data visualizations.
- **Seaborn** – A high-level Python visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed for making attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **FactoMineR** – An R package designed for multivariate data analysis, offering tools to perform methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).
- **FactoExtra** – A companion R package that works with FactoMineR to help visualize and extract the results of multivariate data analyses in an easy and elegant way.
