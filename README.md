# Advanced_Multivariate_Analysis
This repository presents a curated collection of academic projects centered on advanced statistical analysis and data science. It features rigorous implementations of multivariate techniques such as Factor Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), various clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Each project, developed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, is designed to demonstrate both a firm theoretical understanding and a proficient practical application of these methods on sample datasets.
