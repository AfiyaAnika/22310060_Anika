## Introduction
This repository presents a curated collection of academic projects centered on advanced statistical analysis and data science. It features rigorous implementations of multivariate techniques such as **Factor Analysis**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, various clustering algorithms like **DBSCAN**, and **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**. Each project, developed in both **Jupyter Notebook using Python** and **R studio** to demonstrate both a firm theoretical understanding and a proficient practical application of these methods on sample datasets.
